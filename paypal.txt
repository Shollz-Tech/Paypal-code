The Source Code management tool used in our environment in Landmark is GitHub. GitHub is a service platform where developers commit/store their codes. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories. It enables collaboration by allowing teams to share code, review each other's changes via pull requests, and manage projects. It also integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, issue tracking, and other development tools. While Git is the engine, GitHub is the platform that makes collaboration and visibility easier.
